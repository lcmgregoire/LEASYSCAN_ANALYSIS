# __MATERIAL and methods__
##  Description of experiment and plant material
A trial was carried out in the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT, Patancheru, India, 17.5111° N, 78.2752° E ) in  September-October 2023. 
Weather data was recorded during the trial period. The temperature ranged from .. to .. °C, Relative humidity (RH) measured between 7am and 5pm ranged to, the solar radiation ranged from .. to .. Precipitation was recorded, but but no rain occurred during this period. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was calculated using the method proposed by FAO.. The daily VPD ranged between .. to .. during the experiment.

The plant material, correspond to 320 accessions belonging to the list of reference RefSet defined by the Genebank of ICRISAT (Reference). This list includes  contrasting TE genotypes observed in previous experiments (Reference Vadez 1011). 

##Soil filling and growth conditions 
Plants were grown in large trays (40* 60* 30 length–width-height), filled with black soil (see details 60 L vertisoil ??) collected from the ICRISAT farm, and containing 4 plants per tray after thinning. With this density, the canopy of one tray could eventually joined another tray nearby, and create a closed canopy at the end of the experiment.  

The trays were arranged in blocks of  8 x 40 trays in Alpha-lattice of 4 replications, on four trench. 

Planting was done on 14 September in line. **Manure, muriate of potash? Urea? di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) what rate ?**
 Seedlings were thinned a first time at ... DAS and  .. DAS. 
Trays were watered to stay in well-watered condition during the whole experiment. It was performed with a drip irrigation system once every 4 days at 3:00 pm to field capacity. In the timeframe of the experiment, ... irrigations were done. 

##Leasyscan measurements
Measurements were done on the Leasyscan system, a HTP platform which consists of a set of loadcells scales and a Planteye scanner (Reference ).  The platform is located outdoor and is equipped with a rain out shelter that could be moved above the crop in case of rain. The loadcells measured a weight (in g) of each tray every 15 min interval, from 22th September at emergence, to 21 October 2023 at harvest. Over the same period, Planteye, positioned above the canopy, scans and reconstructs the image perceived in 3D. From this 3D estimate, measurements of plant growth are made, including leaf area measurements (in mm²). 
(see Additional file!!)

##Aditionnal measurement
The number of ligulated  (fully-developed) leaves was counted on 10 trays at random per trench (40 in total) 15 days before harvest? 

##Harvest procedures
The shoot part was harvested at ... DAS. Of the four plants per tray, two were used to measure leaf area using a planimeter (Licor brand ??, in cm²). The shoot parts of the four plants per tray were then harvested and dried during 4 days in a forced-air oven at 60°C. Transpiration values and hourly transpiration were calculated for each tray between two weighing measurements.  To consider plant size when estimating transpiration, the transpiration rate (TRrate) was estimated as the ratio between hourly transpiration and leaf area measured at the same period (g. h<sup>-1</sup>. mm<sup>-2</sup>).
